Background:
As a Parking Manager, I am responsible for managing three parking lots:
● The Plaza Park (9 parking capacity)
● City Mall Garage (12 parking capacity)
● Office Tower Parking (9 parking capacity)
I have employed three Parking Boys to help manage these parking lots, each utilizing a specific parking strategy:
1. Standard parking strategy
2. Smart parking strategy
3. Super Smart parking strategy
   To optimize management and streamline operations, I need an application that assists me in visualizing and efficiently managing
   the car parking and retrieval process, while also keeping track of the current usage of each parking lot
